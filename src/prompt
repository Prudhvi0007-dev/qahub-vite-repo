Build a React functional component using Tailwind CSS that replicates a minimal, Apple-inspired horizontal day selector UI.
Layout

Each day is a vertical pill-shaped card
Equal spacing between pills
Overall background is very light gray (#F4F4F4)
Pill Design
Width ~64px, height ~96px

Subtle inner shadow for depth
Soft drop shadow for elevation
Content Inside Pill
Top: weekday letter (T, W, T, F, S)
Small uppercase text

Active Day Styling
Active pill contains:
A perfect red circular badge behind the date number
Circle uses a vertical gradient (from-red-600 to-red-400)
Date text is white and bold
Active pill shadow is stronger
Slight vertical lift (-translate-y-1)
Inactive Day Styling
Date number in muted gray
Slight opacity (80–90%)
Lighter shadow than active
Shadows
Use soft shadows only:
Inactive: shadow-sm
Active: shadow-lg
No harsh borders
